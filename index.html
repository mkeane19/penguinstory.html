<p> There was once a penguin who was hungry. He searched far and wide for food.</p>
<p> He came upon a dog with a backpack on. The penguin said, "Have thouest any food kindly dog?"<br> The dog said, "Yes, but you must give me an egg." <br> The penguin said, "I'm a guy."<br> The dog said, "I know the male penguin carries the eggs." <br> Penguin said, "Fine."<br><img src="http://images.contentful.com/oartd9t7ehdh/6dHDLm4en6CYeik8wws8MU/b1d70a0ee47459914a8650ad34bd647e/620x346-What-Do-Dogs-Have-In-Common-With-Penguins.jpg">The penguin took out his eggs and "accidentally" made them fall towards a bunch of rocks. Then he went and collected them and handed the dog an egg. The dog handed the penguin some fish and said, "thanks for the egg." The penguin said, "no problem" and quickly took off. Later the dog tried to eat the egg and realized it was a rock.</p>
